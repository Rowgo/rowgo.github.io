This meant that their only really hope of hitting the other player was a hail mary, or using the portals to hit the other player in a way they weren't expecting.",

It was a small project and instead of polishing one level we decided it was more important to have a handful of levels that showed of different portal dynamics as they played. I think this level turned out well though considering it was mostly the same from the first draft. It gave a feeling of trying to manage where your opponent could hit you from while trying to figure out which portal could catch them off guard which I think exemplified the feeling of trick shots that we wanted out game to have.",
